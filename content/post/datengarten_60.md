The mass production of DNA amplifiers, which are essential in gene
testing, has become cheap and stable enough that no longer do we have to
rely on big corporations or research institutes. DNA amplifiers are now
being provided to biohackers and educational institutions the world over
to carry out their own independent testing. Through these kinds of
daring activities, Shingo Hisakawa is attempting to improve people’s
literacy in the areas of gene recombination and gene therapy. Hisakawa’s
unusual talents have seen him as a software engineer, hacker, and as
runner-up in the Japan International Birdman Rally. Through the
mobilization of all his machinery and know-how, he is now creating an
environment in which anyone can make their ideas into products, without
the need for a large up-front investment.
