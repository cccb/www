What? Lightning talks are 10 minute  talks about *anything*. Well, anything that won't make other people want to throw you out. Apart from that it can be anything: An idea you have, a problem you cannot solve, your favourite tool or just about anything you think  everybody else should have heard about (i.e. the awesome talk you will  be giving soon)! It's really up to you!
