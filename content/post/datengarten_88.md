Ten years ago no one would have expected the embedded GPU ecosystem in Linux to be what it is now. Today, a large number of GPUs have Open Source support and for those that aren't supported yet, improvements are happening at a rapid pace.

In just the last year Vivante GPUs have gained mainline support and Mali GPUs have seen good progress being made.

In this talk, Robert will cover GPUs in the embedded space and give an overview about their current status, what lies ahead and how the Open Source state of the art compares
to the proprietary alternatives.
