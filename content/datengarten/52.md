With free software, anyone can inspect the source code for malicious
flaws. But Debian provide binary packages to its users. The idea of
“deterministic” or “reproducible” builds is to empower anyone to verify
that no flaws have been introduced during the build process by
reproducing byte-for-byte identical binary packages from a given source.

This talk will explain the current status of the Debian Reproducible
Builds project, how this is relevant for the complete free software eco
system and how you can contribute.

Further Information: see [1](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds)

Note: the talk will be given in German. Please contact Holger if you are
interested to hear this talk in Berlin in English.
