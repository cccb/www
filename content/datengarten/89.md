Computer networking is currently undergoing a transformation: Network control is being consolidated into a centralized “controller” by separating the so-called data plane and control plane. This transformation is what is popularly known as Software-Defined Networking. In this talk we will see how Software-Defined Networks can be exploited by attackers, and on the flip-side, how they can be leveraged to detect network attacks. For example, we will look at topology spoofing attacks, software switch exploitation in the cloud and attacks arising from malicious switches, we will also see novel techniques to detect malicious switches and hosts.
