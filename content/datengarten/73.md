We see everyday members of our communities -especially ones under high
pressure- go burn-out, depressed, or worse. Caring about ourselves and
others is a cultural and strategic blind spot for those, like us, who
were born \"in\" a computer... At the other end of the spectrum,
caregivers lack the understanding of technological realities that
would be necessary to meaningfully reach and get in contact with us
(OpSec and crypto among others).

Hacking with Care aims at bridging this gap, by hacking care and
well-being as a primary strategic objective of our movements, as well
as a joyful tactics that can be shared around. Likewise, HwC aims at
sharing hacker ethics and tools with caregivers, to enable them to
better fulfill their missions.

Hacking with Care is a lose collective, growing literally by contact
and affinity, comprised of hackers, activists, massage, Chinese
medicine practitioners, psycho- and motion-therapists, etc.

Join us for a hands-on discussion about hacking collectively some of
our most precious -yet sometimes unexplored-, complex and beautiful
resources of all: our bodies and our minds!
