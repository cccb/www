In much of the western world, governments have developed the ability to
prevent individuals or organizations from accessing financial services,
with little or no court oversight or ability of those being marginalized
to challenge the rulings. Under the guise of “terrorism” and \"protecting
reputations\", individuals and organizations, from porn stars, to
advocates for those illegally detained in Guantanamo Bay have found
themselves unable to hold bank accounts, unable to accept payments
online, or even had their funds seized without warning by both private
and government actions. In the developing world, the situation can be
just as, if not more, extreme.

In the mean time, Bitcoin has been slowly shedding its anarchistic and
anti-establishment origins and finding places where it can provide
legitimate value within the current financial world. In this talk, we'll
cover both how Bitcoin is in a unique position to provide activists and
marginalized groups access to financial systems to ensure they can
continue their work, while still meeting requirements placed on the
financial system for reasonable law enforcement purposes. We'll touch on
a few cryptographic primitives which, when combined with Bitcoin, can
create incredibly practical and powerful tools to comply with regulation
without giving up privacy, and of course cover a few common
misconceptions about Bitcoin.
