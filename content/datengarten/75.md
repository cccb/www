In recent years, Germany has experienced a massive rise in popularity of
the so-called 'New Right', both in the form of political parties
(\"Alternative für Deutschland\") as well as in non-parliamentary
movements (e.g., \"Pegida\", \"Nein zum Heim\"). A major success factor of
this New Right seems to be their social media activities, especially
their usage of Facebook.
In this talk, we present our findings from two research papers that
analyze structural patterns in the activities of more than one million
users on the Facebook pages of the major German political parties, as
well as more than 200 thousand users on rightwing \"Nein zum Heim\"
protest pages.
