What? Lightning talks are 10 minute talks about *anything*. Well, anything that won't make other people want to throw you out. Apart from that it can be anything: An idea you have, a problem you cannot solve, your favourite tool, or just about anything you think everybody else should have heard about (i.e. the awesome talk you will be giving soon)! It's really up to you!

Talks:

* Peter: Gentoo catalyst instead of $distro+Ansible
* Matthias:  Looking next door through Alice - Your friendly BGP looking glass
* Hanno: MIME-Types, Apache and XSS
* Starbug: Passworte abhören
