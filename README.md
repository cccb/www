Running a dev setup
-------------------

* Get Hugo: <https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing>
* Clone this repo:: `git clone https://github.com/cccb/www`
* Switch directory: `cd www`
* run hugo webserver: `hugo serve`
* Point your browser to `http://localhost:1313`

Every change you make on the projet will be reflected in your browser as
long as `hugo serve` is running.
